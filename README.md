# Tensorflow-Iris
This repository contains solutions to the [Tensorflow problem sheet](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/tensorflow.html) completed as part of my course work for the module [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/). The data set used for this problem sheet is [Fisher's Iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics for the course [B.S.c. (Hons) in Software Developement.](https://www.gmit.ie/software-development/bachelor-science-honours-software-development) The lecturer is  [Dr. Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/).

## Exercises: 
## 01. Use Tensorflow to create model
Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flowerâ€™s sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length. 
## 02. Split the data into training and testing 
Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.
## 03. Train the model 
Use the testing set to train your model.
## 04. Test the model
Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.
